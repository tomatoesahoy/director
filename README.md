This addon aims to give you control over clothes, locations and other world info that AI might often forget about between turns. It adds quick selection for user created outfits for both user/char as well as other world settings.

### Usage

Create a lorebook in world info for clothes, add some things to it, then select that lorebook from the option within the addon. Your clothes menu will populate will all of your lorebook settings. The same works for undies, makeup.

World settings are a bit different, you can modify them. They work on the basic principle of "The <label> is <secondary label>" that gets injected to the AI. This lets you have a setting like "time of day" and then "evening" as an option, so what gets injected is "The time of day is evening." Since that setting works like that, anything you add to it will pop up in the 'world' section. I have included a number of defaults like weather, time of day, season.

### Recommended settings

Make sure chat depth is set to 3, so it is just under author notes (4).
